#blackjack
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). My partner for the project was Henry Ng.

We were given a simple assignment to create a blackjack game using Backbone.js and Coffeescript, as a way of learning both.

This version implements the very basic rules of the game, and uses the same deck (4 shuffled decks) until you refresh the page, so you could use it to test your card-counting skills if you want.

Some basic styling was also done using Bootstrap.
